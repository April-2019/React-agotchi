Small reminders

-Pets are NOT supposed to be deleted. They persist forever
    This is because while a pet dies, they never leave our hearts

-To run the api, make sure you are in the backend directory in terminal and run the following command:
    ``` npm run dev ```
    !!! IF YOU ARE NOT IN BACKEND THIS WILL NOT WORK !!!
-Any questions are free to be thrown my way
